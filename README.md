### Hi, I'm Andrew!

I am a robotics researcher specializing in computer vision and autonomous systems. Environmental perception is foundational for decision-making in complex environments: my work develops novel approaches to solve mapping problems and generate digital twins of real-world locations and objects.

I believe in developing simple, elegant solutions to practical problems. Above all, I strive to make technology that is useful and accessible. I am a proponent of open-source technology; you may find much of my work on GitHub.

Presently, I am a master's student at [Artificially Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (AIMS) Lab](https://cdme.osu.edu/aims-lab) at Ohio State.

Please reach out for the most up-to-date overview of my projects and experiences.
